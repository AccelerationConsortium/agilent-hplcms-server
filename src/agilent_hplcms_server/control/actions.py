"""Single source of truth for ``allowed_actions`` ⇔ control-side refusals.

STATUS_SPEC §6.2: ``<verb> in allowed_actions`` iff a ``POST /control/<verb>``
would NOT refuse right now. This module owns that mapping so the ``/status``
builder and the ``/control/*`` router can never drift — both import from here.

Action names match ``Skill.name`` in the lab skill catalog
(``lab_skills/skill_catalog/hplc.py``):

* ``run.submit``         → ``POST /control/run`` and ``POST /control/queue``
* ``run.abort``          → ``POST /control/abort``
* ``queue.cancel``       → ``DELETE /control/queue/{id}``
* ``instrument.standby`` → ``POST /control/standby``
* ``workflow.start``     → ``POST /control/workflow/start``
* ``workflow.end``       → ``POST /control/workflow/end``

The *enqueue* actions (``run.submit``, ``instrument.standby``, ``workflow.start``)
refuse when the queue is full (412), OpenLab is not up (409 requires_init), or a
technician is driving OpenLab directly (409 instrument_servicing). ``run.abort``
and ``queue.cancel`` carry no device precondition — they only ever shrink the
queue / kill the active process — so they are always offered while the service
itself is operational.

``allowed_actions`` is identity-agnostic by design (§6.2): it reflects the
device's *state* preconditions, not who is calling. Just as it lists
``run.submit`` even though a tokenless caller would get 423, it does not drop
``run.submit`` merely because a workflow holds the claim (that is a per-caller
423 the holder does not hit). ``workflow_active`` only toggles the two workflow
verbs: you cannot start a second workflow while one runs, and ``workflow.end`` is
offered exactly while one is active.

      run; enqueue actions return 412.

      the queue is halted and enqueue actions return 409 instrument_servicing.
